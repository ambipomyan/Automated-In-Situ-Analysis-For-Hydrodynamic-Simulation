The Verification directory contains the analytic solutions for the
various shock tube problems, as computing using Toro's exact Riemann
solver.

To compare Castro output, we need to create 1-d slices in the
direction across the initial discontinuity.  This can be accomplished
using fextract3d.f90 in fParallel/data_processing/

   Creating the Castro slices:

   compile fParallel/data_processing/fextract

   fextract3d.Linux.Intel.exe -d 1 -s sodx.out -p ../sod_x_plt00034
   fextract3d.Linux.Intel.exe -d 2 -s sody.out -p ../sod_y_plt00034
   fextract3d.Linux.Intel.exe -d 3 -s sodz.out -p ../sod_z_plt00034

Gnuplot scripts to plot the data overtop the analytic solutions are
provided.  For Sod's problem, execute

   gnuplot sod_3d.gp

in the Sod/Verification/ directory (where the above slices should have been
output).



NOTES:

-- to get good agreement with the analytic solution for Sod's problem,
   it is necessary to start off with a small timestep.  This is
   accomplished by setting castro.init_shrink = 0.1 in the inputs file.

   Toro notes that this is required for initial discontinuities in section
   6.4.
